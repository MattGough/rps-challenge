RPS Challenge
=============

This challenge was forked from [Makers Academy RPS Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge).
The user stories were as follows:
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```
To meet these requirements I created a web application that allows a user to enter their name, choose their hand and see the result of playing their hand against that randomly generated by the computer. I used the `rspec-sintra` gem to build the web app, and the `rspec` and `capybara` gems for testing the code, in accordance with the principles of TDD.

To play the game run the app from the root folder using `ruby app.rb`, then visit the web app at `http://localhost:4567/`.  The user can then enter their name, choose their hand (ROCK, PAPER or SCISSORS) and see the result of playing against the computer! Then play again by clicking the PLAY AGAIN link.
